_MedPro: Patient Record Management System_

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Java-based website that is designed to organize patient's records/profiles in
a structured and centralized system. It aims to reduce the fragmentation of medical data
by allowing healthcare providers to access a patient's medical data from a single,
secure source.
MedPro's application will focus on clarity, consistency, and accessibility. We will use
intuitive navigation, clean layouts, and role-based dashboards to ensure users only see/access
information relevant to them.

#### ASSIGNMENT 1:
We are required to use GitHub to share this project and configure the project repository.
Each group member must add their details individually using the basic Git commands: git clone, git pull,
git add, git commit -m "", and git push. The project also reuqires creating an "index.html" file that serves as a simple landing page.
Lasty, entities will be added to the project as Spring Beans using the "@Component" annotation. Each bean must
contain attributes with their getters and setters.
Overall, this assignment will help us not only practice using Git commands, but also allow us to start collaborating
with each other and implement concepts we learnt in class.
